## Overview

I really enjoyed this challenge. I decided to use Chart.js to build the chart so I could display the JSON data dynamically. This brought on a lot of challenges which led to a lot of great learning that I am very grateful for. I look forward to using Chart.js on more projects in the future.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process
I went for a mobile first approach, working top down I started with styling the balace div then moved onto the totals and then to the chart. I spent most of the project working in Chart.js. First getting the data and appending it to the chart then I worked on styling the chart and adding the active states then finished with styling the tooltip box. Finally I added the media queries for the responsive desktop design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learnt that I really enjoy Chart.js. I found having good documentation accompanied by some in depth youtube videos made it relatively easy to work with.

### Useful resources

The two resources I used the most were the Chart.js docs.

And the Chart.js tutorials youtube channel.
