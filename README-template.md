## Overview

I really enjoyed this challenge. I decided to use Chart.js to build the chart so I could display the JSON data dynamically. This brought on a lot of challenges which led to a lot of great learning that I am very grateful for. I look forward to using Chart.js on more projects in the future.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current dayâ€™s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### Useful resources


I used this video the help with loading dynamic data from JSON to chart.js.

This video showed me I needed to refactor the boiler plate chart to use a more modern chart.js approach.

Boiler plate code from chart.js. I used this to get started so I could build out the JS logic before styling with CSS.
